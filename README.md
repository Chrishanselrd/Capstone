Understanding human emotions is a complex and nuanced process, traditionally requiring significant time and personal interaction. The advent of machine learning offers the potential to classify and profile emotions efficiently, promising revolutionary advancements across various fields. These advancements include enhancing user experiences, providing an additional layer of authentication, improving mental health therapy, and facilitating better communication. However, the deployment of emotion-detecting technologies also brings substantial privacy concerns. These concerns encompass the potential for creating highly personalized phishing attacks, enabling sophisticated social engineering schemes, and facilitating manipulation and exploitation. 

This research aims to demonstrate how a malicious attacker could utilize machine learning to create an emotional profile from EEG data. By showcasing this potential misuse, we seek to raise awareness about the vulnerability of EEG data to manipulation and highlight the importance of safeguarding such data. 

In this study, data was collected from a single individual who viewed images and listened to different music genres to evoke various emotions. The EEG data was captured and preprocessed to remove noise from the signal. Features were then extracted from the data and fed into several machine learning models. These models were trained and fine-tuned to achieve the best classification accuracy. The experimental results showed classification accuracies of 80%, 79%, 68%, and 77% for pop, rap, classical, and EDM music genres, respectively. 

The significance of this study lies in its demonstration of the ease with which machine learning can be used to exploit EEG data, highlighting the urgent need for robust data protection measures. This research underscores the dual-use nature of emotion-detecting technologies and calls for a balanced approach that maximizes benefits while mitigating risks. By bringing attention to these issues, we aim to foster the development of ethical standards and safeguards to protect individuals from potential abuses of their emotional data.
